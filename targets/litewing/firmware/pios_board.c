     *
     * The mixer rows stay the textbook quad X. What changes is which PIN each
     * row drives, via ChannelAddr below -- reordering outputs rather than
     * rewriting the mixer keeps the GCS mixer tab showing the conventional
     * table an operator expects.
     *
     * Corner geometry is read off the PCB (LieWingV2.6.C.kicad_pcb), not
     * guessed. Motor connector placements, KiCad coordinates with Y down:
     *
     *   J7   MOT_1  GPIO5   x 177.7  y  62.3   right, toward the "top" edge
     *   J8   MOT_2  GPIO6   x 179.1  y 124.4   right, toward the "bottom"
     *   J9   MOT_3  GPIO3   x 117.1  y 125.9   left,  toward the "bottom"
     *   J10  MOT_4  GPIO4   x 115.6  y  63.9   left,  toward the "top"
     *
     * Prop rotation comes off the silkscreen, which marks each position A or
     * B and prints the motor wire colours beside it:
     *
     *   J7  = B (black/white)      J8  = A (red/blue)
     *   J9  = B (black/white)      J10 = A (red/blue)
     *
     * A and B fall on opposite diagonals, which is exactly the quad X rule,
     * and it confirms the diagonal PAIRING is J7+J9 against J8+J10. Note it
     * does NOT fix which edge is the nose: the pattern is symmetric under a
     * 180 degree rotation, so both "top is front" and "bottom is front" fit
     * it. Taking the top edge as the nose:
     *
     *   mixer row 1  front-left   -> MOT_4  GPIO4   A  CW
     *   mixer row 2  front-right  -> MOT_1  GPIO5   B  CCW
     *   mixer row 3  rear-right   -> MOT_2  GPIO6   A  CW
     *   mixer row 4  rear-left    -> MOT_3  GPIO3   B  CCW
     *
     * The previous mapping had ChannelAddr 0,1,2,3, i.e. it treated MOT_1 as
     * front-left. The PCB says MOT_1 is on the RIGHT, so that was a quarter
     * turn out -- roll and pitch would both have been wrong while the yaw
     * pairing happened to survive.
     *
     * STILL TO CONFIRM: which edge is the nose, which is the same question as
     * which way the MPU6050's +X points. Settle it before flying, props off:
     * tilt the board nose-down and watch AttitudeState -- pitch should go
     * NEGATIVE. If it goes positive the frame is 180 degrees out, and the fix
     * is to swap the diagonal pairs (ChannelAddr 1,2,3,0 becomes 3,0,1,2).
