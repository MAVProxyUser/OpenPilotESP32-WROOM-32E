 * RF motor idle-point calibration -- no USB anywhere near a battery.
 *
 * Battery and USB must never be connected together on this airframe (the

 * the RC link and answered on the LED. User's protocol, near verbatim:
 *
 *   ENTER  within ~2.5s of the RC link at power-up, wiggle the flight-mode
 *          switch extreme-to-extreme four times, throttle at rest (LOW).
 *          No throttle gesture is part of entry, by user veto: training a
 *          hand to power up with the throttle pinned is a habit that
 *          eventually meets a live aircraft. No TX means no entry.
 *          LED gives 5 quick blinks on entry.
 *   PHASE  for motor N (1..4) the LED blinks N times, pauses, repeats.
 *          The throttle stick drives THAT MOTOR ALONE, live:
 *          1000..1400us across the stick. Raise it until the motor just
 *          spins.
 *   MARK   flick the switch to CENTER: the current value is captured,
 *          the motor stops, LED goes solid a moment -- return the switch
 *          to the entry extreme and the next phase begins.
 *   ABORT  switch to the OPPOSITE extreme at any time: nothing is saved.
 *   DONE   after motor 4: ChannelNeutral[0..3] = captured + 20 (capped
 *          1200), saved to flash. LED strobes 2s, then double-pulses until
 *          power-off. Power cycle to fly.
 *
 * Runs at the tail of PIOS_Board_Init: modules have not started, so nothing

    /*
     * ESC endpoint calibration -- the USB-FREE way, and the only way on
     * this airframe. The BEC's 5V feeds VUSB, so battery and USB must
     * never be connected together (hard rule). Serial-driven calibration
     * tools are therefore impossible; instead the board does the classic
     * ritual itself at power-up, on battery power alone:
     *
     *   flash this build over USB -> UNPLUG USB -> connect battery.
     *   Board and ESCs power up together; all four outputs are already at
     *   MAX, so every ESC enters calibration and sings its max tone.
     *   6 seconds later the outputs drop to MIN; ESCs store the range and
     *   arm. LED: solid during MAX, fast blink during MIN, then normal.
     *
     *   Then reflash the normal build. PROPS OFF THROUGHOUT.
     *
     * Every power-up of THIS build recalibrates, which is why it must
     * never ship enabled -- same rule as BOARD_PWM_SELFTEST.
