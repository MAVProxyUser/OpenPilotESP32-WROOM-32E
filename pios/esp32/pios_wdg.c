 * @brief      ESP32 watchdog, backed by the IDF Task WDT.
 *
 * PiOS's watchdog is a flag scheme, not a plain kick: each participating task
 * registers a bit, sets it once per pass, and only when EVERY registered bit
 * has been seen does PIOS_WDG_Clear() actually pet the hardware. That means a
 * single stalled task takes the board down even while the others keep running,
 * which is the behaviour you want from a flight controller.
 *
 * This is deliberately ENABLED on this target. (The ArduPilot ESP32 port
 * disables both the interrupt and task watchdogs in sdkconfig because its loop
 * overruns kept tripping them; we are not carrying that problem, so there is
 * no reason to fly without the protection.)

 * ONE task owns the IDF watchdog.
 *
 * The IDF watchdog is per-task: esp_task_wdt_add() subscribes whichever task
 * calls it and esp_task_wdt_reset() only ever resets the caller's own entry,
 * with no way to reset on another task's behalf. PiOS is the other shape
 * entirely -- participants set a flag bit and whichever one completes the set
 * does the petting, so the task that reaches the watchdog changes pass to pass.
 *
 * Two earlier attempts to bridge that gap are worth recording, because both
 * failed on hardware:
 *
 *   1. A single global "already subscribed" bool. The first task to arrive
 *      subscribed itself and set the flag; every other task then read the flag
 *      as proof it was subscribed too and called esp_task_wdt_reset() having
 *      never been added. That fails with ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND and logged an error
 *      at roughly 50 lines a second -- and meant only one of the four
 *      participating tasks was ever really being watched.
 *
 *   2. Subscribing each task lazily on its first check-in. Correct in
 *      principle, fatal in practice: it puts esp_task_wdt_status() and
 *      esp_task_wdt_add() on the hot path of flight tasks whose stacks are
 *      sized to the byte, and the board panicked inside the IDF watchdog on
 *      the very first check-in with a corrupted list. (See the note on
 *      xTaskCreate stack units in PIOS_WDG_Init.)
 *
 * So: the flight tasks only ever set a bit, which costs a spinlock and no
 * calls. This task -- with a stack of its own, sized for the job -- is the
 * only thing that ever touches the IDF watchdog.
