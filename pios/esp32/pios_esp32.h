 * @brief      Top-level PiOS header for the ESP32 (Xtensa LX6) architecture.
 *
 * This mirrors the role pios_sim_posix.h plays for the POSIX targets: pios.h
 * keys the whole architecture selection off USE_<BOARD>, and this file is the
 * ESP32 branch. Nothing STM32 is reachable from here.
 *
 * The important structural difference from the STM32 targets is that we run on
 * ESP-IDF's own FreeRTOS build, not the kernel vendored under
 * pios/common/libraries/FreeRTOS. ESP-IDF owns FreeRTOSConfig.h (it is
 * generated from sdkconfig), owns the linker script, and has already started
 * the scheduler by the time our entry point runs. See esp32wroom.c.

 * Task stacks: WORDS in, BYTES out.

 * module in this tree was written against -- counts WORDS, and they all say
 *
 *     xTaskCreate(fooTask, "Foo", STACK_SIZE_BYTES / 4, ...);
 *
 * Left alone on IDF, that asks for a QUARTER of the intended stack. The
 * telemetry RX task ran on 2KB of the 8KB it thought it had; Attitude on 1KB
 * of 4KB; Receiver on 768 bytes of 3KB.
 *
 * The failure mode is not a clean overflow report. The canary is missed and
 * whatever sits below the stack is corrupted instead, surfacing much later and
 * somewhere else entirely -- LoadProhibited inside vTaskSwitchContext, or in
 * PIOS_COM_validate, or in runNextCallback -- with nothing pointing back at
 * the task that actually overran.
 *
 * Rather than edit the xTaskCreate call in every shared module, convert the
 * unit here, once. Every stack size in this port therefore keeps the vanilla
 * FreeRTOS meaning it has on the STM32 targets.
 *
 * This MUST come after freertos/task.h above: it is a function-like macro on
 * the same name, and it would otherwise mangle the prototype in that header.
