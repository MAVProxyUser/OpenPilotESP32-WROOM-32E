 * @brief      uxTaskGetRunTime() for ESP-IDF's FreeRTOS build.
 *
 * pios/common/pios_task_monitor.c calls uxTaskGetRunTime(), which is NOT stock
 * FreeRTOS -- it is this tree's one deliberate local patch on top of V11.3.0
 * (see the FreeRTOS section of CLAUDE.md): a read-and-clear per-task run-time
 * counter.
 *
 * We cannot carry that patch here, because this target links against ESP-IDF's
 * own FreeRTOS build rather than the vendored kernel, and the standing rule in
 * this repo is not to patch kernel internals anyway. So the same semantics are
 * reconstructed at the PiOS layer out of stock API: uxTaskGetSystemState()
 * reports each task's cumulative ulRunTimeCounter, and this file keeps the
 * previous reading per task and returns the delta.
 *
 * Requires CONFIG_FREERTOS_GENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS=y and
 * CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_TRACE_FACILITY=y (both set in sdkconfig.defaults).
 * Without them the counters read zero and the task monitor simply reports 0%
 * rather than misbehaving.
