"""
rc_calibrate - measure your transmitter's real stick travel and store it.

The seeded endpoints (342/1024/1706) are the textbook DSM 2048 range. Your
transmitter almost certainly does not match them exactly: travel adjust,
sub-trim and dual rates all move the ends, and a channel whose stored range is
wider than its real one will never reach full deflection, while a narrower one
saturates early and feels twitchy off centre.

This measures what your sticks actually produce, then writes it to the board
and saves it to flash.

    PROPS OFF. Nothing here arms the aircraft, but you will be moving the
    throttle stick through its full range.

Usage:
