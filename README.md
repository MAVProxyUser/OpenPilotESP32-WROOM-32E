# OpenPilotESP32

An ESP32 port of the NinjaPilot flight code: a slim target for a bare
**ESP32-WROOM-32E** module running the CC-class stack -- complementary-filter
attitude plus the full Stabilization module (Rate, Attitude self-leveling,
AxisLock, Rattitude and the rest; the first hover was flown in Attitude). What
it leaves out is the navigation stack: no baro, mag or GPS, so no altitude or
position modes.

This project lives **outside** the NinjaPilot tree on purpose. It consumes that
tree's flight code and does not modify it — the handful of upstream changes a
HAL port unavoidably needs are kept as a patch you apply and revert on demand.

## Status

**HOVERED 2026-09-02.** The 4-inch QuadX flew a stable hover on this
firmware under transmitter control, after two real crashes and one night of
finding what each of them was actually caused by (the section below). The
configuration that hovered: `AttitudeSettings.BoardRotation = (0,0,180)`
(the IMU's +x points at the tail), gesture arming with the quad on the
ground and untouched (the estimator learns gyro bias during the arming
second), an idle low enough that four equal idle thrusts cannot lift the
light end (the battery sits aft), 41 Hz DLPF, Rate yaw, MotorsSpinWhileArmed,
4-inch-class Bank1 defaults. `tools/flight_monitor.py` gave a preflight GO
and recorded the flight. Level trims are zero (they were measured in the
old frame) - re-level next; gains are "hovers", nothing finer yet.

**Flies the whole control chain on the bench.** SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus
(ESP32-D0WD-V3 rev 3.0), ESP-IDF v5.3.2 / GCC 13.2, built on macOS arm64.
Both cores are in use: every flight task is pinned to core 1, WiFi and lwIP
stay on core 0.

- ICM-20602 at 500 Hz over SPI with a data-ready interrupt; complementary
  filter attitude (`AttitudeState` tracks tilt correctly, both signs)
- Spektrum DSMX satellite (SPM9745) live on RX1; all channels calibrated,
  including per-channel reversal, via `tools/rc_check.py --apply`
- Arms from the transmitter (yaw-right hold), stabilizes, spins motors on the
  QuadX mixer, disarms; verified end to end with `tools/motor_watch.py`
- Settings persist across power cycles: `PIOS_FLASHFS` on NVS (its own
  partition; WiFi credentials live separately in the default NVS partition)
- WiFi telemetry: UAVTalk over TCP :9000, UDP discovery beacon on :9999,
  credentials provisioned offline by `tools/wifi_setup.py`. Modem power save
  is off -- deterministic latency beats standby current on a flight board
- Motor idle points come from the wizard's output-calibration page over
  WiFi (battery power, no USB). True ESC range calibration is the
  BOARD_ESC_CAL boot mode: flash it over USB with no battery, unplug,
  connect the battery, and the board boots straight into the max-then-min
  sequence inside the ESCs' calibration window
- The NinjaPilot GCS is fully board-aware: the Setup Wizard recognises
  0x1202, locks input to the Spektrum satellite, draws the Thing Plus in
  its connection diagram, and never offers ESC range calibration (it
  needs the controller alive before the ESCs power, impossible on a
  single-rail board -- output calibration is offered on network links
  instead). The vehicle, output and attitude config pages all carry the
  real pin names and the CC-style calibration screens; the hardware tab
  is a reference card. The firmware reports a full version blob (git
  hash, date, UAVO-set sha1) and honors the GCS's IAP reboot sequence,
  so post-save reboots happen automatically instead of ending in a
  "Reboot failed" dialog
- Telemetry serves TCP and UDP on port 9000; UDP is preferred (a connected
  TCP client arms lwIP's 250 ms tcp fast timer -- the residual scheduler
  stall source; a UDP client never starts it). The UDP stream stays with
  its holder (a new sender takes over only after 3 s of holder silence),
  and the flight view is genuinely live: AttitudeState at 25 Hz,
  ManualControlCommand at 4 Hz
- GCS connects are cheap: metaobjects fetch lazily on first use instead of
  at connect (157 -> 46 objects), and a SettingsGeneration token lets
  reconnects skip refetching unchanged settings entirely (down to ~11)
- The stabilization loop watchdog judges wall-clock pass gap (warn 12 ms /
  critical 30 ms) instead of counting missed samples, so the characterized
  ~3.6 ms scheduler stalls no longer blink STAB at an idle bench
- 60 s characterization with WiFi telemetry active, full flight stack:
  0 Attitude alarm events, 7 Stabilization warnings/min, CPU 34 %

**Not yet done:** re-level after the frame fix, judge gains from hover
logs, no baro / mag / GPS (rate and attitude flight only), no DShot.

## The 2026-09-01 flip: root cause and fix (corrected 2026-09-02)

Two real flights ended in a flip at first liftoff thrust. **Root cause: the
IMU is mounted with its +x axis pointing at the airframe's TAIL** (yaw 180
from the frame). Confirmed on the quad with `tools/orientation_check.py`:
airframe nose down -> board reads NOSE UP 45 deg (raw acc.x +7.0); left arm
down -> RIGHT SIDE DOWN 48 deg (acc.y -7.5); level -> acc.z -9.8, so z is
fine and only x/y are reversed. With a correct QuadX mixer (M1/M2 on the
airframe's front, CC3D heritage) that is positive feedback on both axes:
the FC raises the pair on ITS low side, which is the airframe's HIGH side,
so every correction pushed the tilt further over and the quad went the
moment it had enough thrust to follow the command.

**Fix: `AttitudeSettings.BoardRotation = (0, 0, 180)`**, saved, power cycle,
then `orientation_check.py` must read straight:

```bash
python3 tools/apply_recommended_settings.py --board-rotation 0,0,180
```

`flight_monitor.py` preflight FAILs unless Yaw is 180; `bench_test.py` runs
an orientation gate (tip the nose down, press Enter, must read NOSE DOWN)
before it will arm. Re-level afterwards (roll/pitch trims were computed in
the old frame and are zeroed). Yaw control is unaffected (z unchanged;
M1<->M3 and M2<->M4 keep their spin directions).

What the first investigation got wrong, and why it matters: every
board-side consistency check - estimate vs gyro, estimate vs accel, mixer
vs estimate - PASSES on a backwards board, because they are all in the
board's own frame. The 9-degree estimate/accel gap in the crash log was the
complementary filter lagging a fast forced rotation, a symptom, not the
cause; "vibration through the 176 Hz DLPF" was an inference on top of it.
Props-off vibration measured 1-2 deg/s gyro delta at every throttle band.
The 41 Hz DLPF stays (right for a 4-inch frame) but fixed nothing. Only a
HUMAN reference - tip the real nose - reveals a frame offset, and the first
bench run's voice-lagged labels read it backwards; the paced/Enter-confirmed
run and the direct five-ask check read it right.

Second lesson from the same night (2026-09-02 01:28 bench): the CC estimator
learns gyro bias with a 0.2 s time constant during its first ~7 s after
power-up and again during the arming second (`ZeroDuringArming` TRUE). The
tool armed while the quad was still being rolled back to level and learned
-54 deg/s of roll rate as bias; the roll estimate wandered past 90 deg for the
whole run while the accelerometer read the truth. Keep the quad still through
power-up and arming; `bench_test.py` now waits for a quiet gyro, checks the
resting bias before and after arming (limit 4 deg/s) and disarms if one was
learned; `flight_monitor.py` fails preflight on a biased gyro and flags a bias
that appears after any arming.

Prebuilt images in the repo root, from this exact tree:

- `firmware_normal_41hz.bin` - the flight build: 41Hz DLPF, self-leveling
  Stabilized3 defaults, Rate-yaw default (no AxisLock arming-gesture
  windup), MotorsSpinWhileArmed default TRUE, GCS receiver bound as an
  input source (lets tools/bench_test.py drive the throttle over UDP;
  grade its log offline with tools/bench_report.py),
  and 4-inch-class Bank1 defaults. The onboard Flip module is NOT in this
  build (sim-twin only, per operator call - the FlipStatus object is
  compiled but inert so the UAVO set still matches the sim) (rate 0.0032/0.0075/0.00005, attitude Kp
  3.2 - modest refinements inside the envelope CC3D-era 250s flew; the
  Autotune module is deliberately NOT built for the real board).
  Settings persistence: NVS-backed, keyed by object id + instance,
  size-validated on load (a layout change orphans old blobs safely),
  committed on save; compiled-in Quad X defaults touch only an
  unprovisioned board. NOTE: a board with a SAVED Bank1 keeps its saved
  values - check the GCS after flashing and clear/set the bank if the
  new defaults are wanted.
- `firmware_esc_cal.bin` - the BOARD_ESC_CAL power-up calibration variant.
  Flash, unplug USB, battery on, listen for the tones, reflash normal.
  Never fly this build.

Flash recipes and the full ESC-calibration ritual: SKILL.md.

## Remote ID broadcast (ASTM F3411)

`flight/modules/RemoteID` (carried in the shared patch) encodes the aircraft's
identity and state into a Broadcast Remote ID Message Pack once a second, using
the reference encoder (`flight/libraries/opendroneid`, opendroneid-core-c,
Apache-2.0, vendored unmodified). On the ESP32 the pack rides as a vendor
element (OUI FA:0B:BC, type 0x0D) in the beacons and probe responses of a
soft-AP named `RID-xxxxxx` that runs alongside the telemetry station (or on
its own on channel 6 when no WiFi credentials are stored). The WiFi driver
repeats it in every 100 ms beacon; no task of ours touches the radio.

Messages: Basic ID (your ID type + ID + UA type), Location/Vector (armed
state; position, altitude, speed, track and time from `GPSPositionSensor` /
`GPSTime` when there is a fix), System (operator location = the position at
arming), Self-ID (free text), Operator ID.

```bash
python3 tools/remoteid_setup.py --id-type CAARegistrationID --uas-id FA3xxxxxxxxx \
    --operator-id FA3xxxxxxxxx --self-id "4in quad" --enable    # persists in NVS
python3 tools/remoteid_setup.py --status
```

Receivers: the OpenDroneID app on Android, or any F3411 WiFi-beacon scanner.
On the sim twin the same element bytes go to UDP :9020 and
`tools/remoteid_listen.py` decodes them like a receiver would; `--hex` decodes
a captured element.

**What this is and is not.** It is a correct, standards-shaped broadcast. It
is not, on this airframe today, legal Remote ID: there is no GPS, so the
Location message carries the standard's "unknown" encodings, and FAA Part 89
requires position (and a Declaration of Compliance a home-built transmitter
does not have). Put a GPS on the spare UART2 and the Location and System
messages fill themselves in; the module never invents a position. Shipped in
`firmware_remoteid.bin` (= the hovered build + this module, disabled until
you run the setup tool). `firmware_normal_41hz.bin` remains the image that
flew.

## Other targets

An experimental **ESP32-S2** port lives on the
[`esp32s2`](https://github.com/MAVProxyUser/OpenPilotESP32-WROOM-32E/tree/esp32s2)
branch. It builds, flashes and boots on real S2 silicon, with an LEDC servo
backend (the S2 has no MCPWM at all), core-count-aware task creation (it is a
single-core part), and a relocated pin map (GPIO 22-25 do not exist there and
26-32 are the module's flash). Nothing on the sensor or control path is
validated on it -- no IMU was wired.

[ESP32-S2.md](ESP32-S2.md) carries the full set of differences, traps and next
steps, and explains why the **S3**, not the S2, is the target to pick if you are
moving off the original ESP32. That file is on `main` deliberately; the code it
describes is only on the branch.

## Why this is worth doing

CopterControl runs the same flight code at `PIOS_SENSOR_RATE 500.0f` on an
STM32F103CBT: 72 MHz Cortex-M3, 20 KB SRAM, **no FPU** — every float software
emulated. Its firmware bank is 116 KB.

A WROOM-32E is 240 MHz with a hardware single-precision FPU and 520 KB of SRAM.
The build backs the premise up: **168 KB of `.flash.text`** on a part with
520 KB of SRAM, so the whole executable would fit on-chip with room to spare.
The XIP cache-thrash that caps ArduPilot's ESP32 port near 150 Hz is not the
constraint here — ArduPilot is pushing ~2 MB through the same cache.

Then follow SKILL.md for generating UAVObjects, building, flashing and talking

## About the patch

A HAL port has to hook the architecture dispatch point, so `flight/pios/pios.h`
gains a third branch next to the existing `USE_SIM_POSIX` one. Everything in
the patch is additive and guarded, so coptercontrol / simposix / realposix
compile to the same code as before. Two entries are genuine upstream bug fixes
found by this work:

- `pios_callbackscheduler.c` — when a scheduler task for a priority already
  existed, `Create()` returned without updating `stackSize`, so the shared
  stack was whatever the *first* caller asked for. Now takes the maximum.
  **This does increase stack allocation on other targets.**
- `uavtalk.c` — the receive state machine's checksum state read the CRC
  byte without checking the feed buffer still had one. A frame whose
  header+payload ends exactly on a receive-chunk boundary (118-byte
  ActuatorSettings against a 128-byte telemetry read) consumed a stale
  byte as its CRC and was dropped with no NACK, on every attempt. Every
  other state already guarded against feed starvation.
- `attitude.c` — the ADXL345-only read path was not guarded by
  `PIOS_INCLUDE_ADXL345` (every other use of that driver in the file is), and
  the task stack was hardcoded at 540 bytes with no per-board override.

The GCS entries make it talk to an ESP32 at all: deassert DTR/RTS on open (they
are wired to EN/RESET on these adapters), and make the auto-connect preference
overridable instead of hardcoded to UDP — default behaviour is unchanged.

`patches/mpu6000-i2c-and-icm20602.patch` is separate and **not applied**: it
adds an I2C transport to the MPU6000 driver, for breakouts that do not bring
SDO/AD0 out to a pin and so cannot do 4-wire SPI.

## Simulation twin: fw_simwroom

The flight tree gains a posix target that is this board, minus the silicon:
`flight/targets/boards/simwroom/` builds `fw_simwroom.elf`, a native process
that runs the SAME control stack as the hardware — the CC-style Attitude
complementary filter, the same module set (Receiver, ManualControl,
Stabilization, Attitude, Actuator, Telemetry), no Revo estimator, no nav
stack. It exists so a change can be flown in Gazebo before it is flown in the
back yard.

What makes it a twin rather than another simposix:

- **Same board identity.** It reports board id 0x1202 (type 0x12 rev 0x02)
  through FirmwareIAPObj, with a real "OpFw" description blob (git hash,
  build time, UAVO-set sha1), so the GCS gives it the same config screens,
  the same silkscreen pin labels and the same version check as the hardware.
- **Same IMU contract.** attitude.c compiles down the same
  `PIOS_INCLUDE_ICM20602` branch the ESP32 build takes. The posix driver
  (`flight/pios/posix/pios_icm20602_sim.c`) registers as
  `PIOS_ICM20602_Driver` and advertises the REAL board's scale factors
  (±2000 dps → 1/16.4, ±8 g → g/4096, from board_hw_defs.c), so calibration
  settings behave identically. Sensor data arrives as GyroSensor/AccelSensor
  UAVObjects — exactly what the Gazebo bridge publishes — and is packed into
  the same int16 queue records the hardware driver produces.
- **Same reboot protocol.** The GCS IAP sequence (1122/2233/3344) ends the
  process cleanly instead of restarting a chip.

Build and try it (in the NinjaPilot tree, via the space-free symlink):

```bash
cd /tmp/njp && make ROOT_DIR=$PWD fw_simwroom
build/fw_simwroom/fw_simwroom.elf   # binds UAVTalk on UDP :9000
```

Verified: boots, hands the GCS/pyuavtalk board id 0x1202 and the version
blob, streams AttitudeState at 25 Hz, and integrates streamed GyroSensor
data through the complementary filter (a 20 deg/s roll feed rolls the
attitude, accel pulls it level again — the filter behaving as on hardware).

**Flying it in Gazebo** (`NINJAPILOT_TARGET=wroom`): the bridge grew
pilot-in-the-loop modes (`wroom_pilot.py`) because this stack has no
PathFollower -- the FC only stabilizes attitude, so the harness flies it
the way a human would, sticks over GCSReceiver, guidance reading the GPS
objects ONLY (the board's real sensor situation). One command per run:

```bash
ground/gazebo_bridge/run_wroom.sh <label> [hover|sticks|rth]
```

First-day results (2026-09-01, all GPS-only feedback at 10 Hz):

- `hover` -- takeoff to 4m, 30s hold: altitude rms 0.15m, max horizontal
  drift 0.29m, clean touchdown. Needed a slow throttle-trim integrator
  (the X3 hovers at 0.702, not the assumed 0.68 -- a P-only cascade
  parks 0.64m low on exactly that bias).
- `sticks` -- scripted pokes: FC attitude tracks commanded angles within
  ~2 deg, and the sign conventions verified themselves (+roll stick =
  bank right = drift East).
- `rth` -- fly out 15m, climb to 8m, return, land: touchdown 0.40m from
  the pad, first attempt. So yes: THIS stack can fly a GPS-only RTH --
  with the guidance loop outside the firmware. (Caveat: gz navsat is
  ublox-grade clean; real GPS noise will widen that number.)

**The backflip is now ONBOARD (sim twin only, for now)** - flip.pde came
home to the board. `flight/modules/Flip` (compiled into the sim twin;
deliberately NOT into the real ESP32 firmware until it has earned trust
there) runs the whole maneuver at task rate against loop-fresh gyro
data: the ground side writes `FlipStatus.Command = Flip` and the board
owns punch, rotation (angle from the gyro integral - measured dt, never
assumed), spin-kill, and catch, with stabilizedhandler deferring to the
sequencer while it runs. Sim-validated 10/10 across two 5-flip batches:
~10s cycles, lows 6.5-7.5m, every catch clean. NOT yet flown on real
hardware - that needs Bank2 provisioning on the board, a trigger path,
and a deliberate decision (and a lot of open air).

The lag chronicle, for the record: the ground-piloted flip fought a
~0.25s stick-transport lag; onboard has none - and promptly relearned
the OTHER lessons at 100Hz: an integral that adds gyro*nominal-dt loses
every scheduler tick (352 deg believed vs ~500 real); a taper must be
gentle enough for the rate loop to physically track (gain 1.9, the
effective slope the piloted flips flew - a 900 deg/s^2 trapezoid exits
at 355 deg/s); and a sensorless anti-drift lean overcorrects (the board
arrests vertically, whoever can SEE velocity brakes horizontally).

**The ground-piloted flip** (previous milestone, kept for A/B on switch
position 5): (`run_wroom.sh <label> flip`, `NINJAPILOT_WROOM_FLIPS=n`
for repeats): switch position 1 is a flip slot (Stabilized2 =
Rate/Rate/Rate/Manual pulling Bank2, ManualRate.Pitch 540 deg/s via
FlightModeMap) and the pilot flies punch -> full-rate rotation ->
angle-closed-loop taper -> Attitude-mode catch -> arrest -> recover.
15/15 completed across three consecutive five-flip flights: rotation
0.75-0.88s, lowest point 4.4-8.1m against a 1.5m abort floor, every
catch clean. The hard-won lessons live as comments in wroom_pilot.py;
the headline three, each paid for with a crashed run: differential
torque scales with collective so the mixer has NO attitude authority at
full throttle (arrest at 0.90, never higher); "stop rotating" is not a
recovery (rate mode parks contentedly upside down - the taper must land
the rotation ON level); and the ~0.25s stick-command latency is 125 deg
at flip rate, so the endgame steers by a lag-PREDICTED angle, not the
telemetry's.

## Hardware

The complete parts list, wiring table and the settings that made the first
hover are in [BOM.md](BOM.md).

3.3 V only. The WROOM-32 has **no USB peripheral** — the USB socket is a
CP2102/CH340 UART bridge, so serial UAVTalk runs over UART0 through it (or
skip the cable entirely and use WiFi telemetry).

The deployed board is a **SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus**; pins below are its
silkscreen names where it has them.

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UART0 TX / RX | 1 / 3 | serial UAVTalk via the USB bridge |
| SPI3 SCLK / MISO / MOSI | 5 / 19 / 18 | sensor bus |
| IMU CS | 14 | plain GPIO, driven by PiOS |
| IMU INT (data ready) | 32 | GPIO34 would be nicer (input-only) but is not on the Thing Plus headers |
| DSM satellite in | 16 (RX1) | UART2, Spektrum serial stream |
| Motor 1–4 | 15, 33, 27, 12 | MCPWM quad X: NW, NE, SE, SW |
| LED | 13 | slow blink disarmed, fast strobe armed |
| BOOT button (0) | 0 | hold ~3 s at power-up: erase stored settings |

GPIO12 (Motor 4) is MTDI, a flash-voltage strapping pin; using it as an
output required burning the `XPD_SDIO_FORCE` eFuse (one-way, per-chip) so
the strap is ignored. PPM input exists in the tree but is compiled out:
its RMT receiver on an unconnected pin collects coupled noise edges, and
servicing them periodically starved the gyro interrupt. Re-enable only
with a real PPM source wired.

### Power — the one hard rule

**Never connect the flight battery and USB at the same time.** The ESC/BEC
5 V line feeds VUSB on this board, so two supplies end up on one rail.
Everything that needs motors powered (RF motor calibration, the wizard's
ESC/output calibration over WiFi) is designed to run on battery power with
no USB attached; everything on USB runs with motors unpowered.

There is no firmware interlock for this, deliberately: the only signal a
detector could read (the CP2102 waking up on the VUSB rail) is also
energized by the BEC in the flight configuration, so it cannot tell a USB
cable from battery power and would block arming in flight. The rule is
procedural.

### IMU

Use an **ICM-20602**. It is MPU-6500 family, so it shares the MPU6000 register
map byte-for-byte in everything the driver touches — same 14-byte burst from
`ACCEL_XOUT_H`, same config registers, same scaling. The only change it needed
was widening the `WHO_AM_I` gate to accept 0x12 alongside 0x68 and 0x70.

Wire SDO to GPIO19 and **leave SA0 unconnected** — on Invensense parts AD0/SDO
is often one net internally, and grounding SA0 would short MISO.

Not recommended: the **ICM-20948** is a different architecture (banked
registers, `WHO_AM_I` 0xEA, mag behind an internal I2C master) and needs a new
driver. The **BNO08x** does its own sensor fusion on an onboard Cortex-M0+ and
speaks SHTP; it is excellent for robotics orientation and the wrong shape for a
flight controller that wants raw high-rate gyro for its own filter.

### SPI or I2C

| | pins | 15-byte sensor read | of a 500 Hz period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I2C @ 400 kHz | 2 | ~390 µs | ~19% |
| SPI @ 8 MHz | 4 | ~15 µs | ~0.8% |

I2C wins on pins, SPI on speed — by ~25×. Both work at 500 Hz. Prefer SPI
anyway: it is push-pull and deterministic, and has no equivalent of I2C bus
lockup, which is a classic source of intermittent sensor faults on airframes.

## Known gaps and characterized behavior

- **No baro / mag / GPS.** Rate and attitude flight only; no altitude hold or
  navigation. No DShot (MCPWM speaks plain PWM; OneShot requests from the GCS
  wizard are clamped to 400 Hz PWM).
- **Periodic ~4 ms scheduler stalls exist and are tolerated, not eliminated.**
  lwIP timer work on core 0 collides with flight tasks through the FreeRTOS
  SMP kernel lock (~2/s idle, ~4/s with a TCP telemetry client). Sensor
  samples are queued, not lost; the attitude consumer waits 5 sample periods
  before alarming. Unicore builds had the same stalls — the tick froze inside
  the windows, so nothing could see them.
- **WiFi is a bench feature.** Erase credentials before flying
  (`tools/wifi_setup.py erase`); the radio's task load is characterized but
  the airframe RF environment is not.
- `make gcs` cannot work on macOS — see SKILL.md for the qmake route.

## Bench bring-up, as it actually went

1. Console banner, LED heartbeat, GCS link over UART0
2. ICM-20602 answers `WHO_AM_I` 0x12; sensors sane at rest
3. `AttitudeState` level and tracking both signs — the leveling test
4. DSM satellite streaming; channels mapped, reversed and calibrated
   (`tools/rc_check.py`, `tools/rc_calibrate.py`, `tools/rc_monitor.py`)
5. Arm from the transmitter; motors on the QuadX mixer with props off
   (`tools/motor_watch.py` shows commanded vs actual per channel)
6. Motor idle points set with the wizard's output calibration over WiFi
7. WiFi telemetry on; 60 s characterization with the full stack live
